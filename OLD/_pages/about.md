Hi, I'm Nikhil!

I'm a senior research scientist at Harvard's [Kempner Institute](https://kempnerinstitute.harvard.edu/).  Before that, I was a research scientist at Amazon working on NLP and before that, I was a postdoctoral fellow in theoretical physics at McGill University as part of the [Simon's Collaboration on the Nonperturbative Bootstrap](https://bootstrapcollaboration.com/).  I completed by PhD in 2018 at Johns Hopkins University where I was advised by [Jared Kaplan](https://sites.krieger.jhu.edu/jared-kaplan/), and my Bachelor's at UC Berkeley in 2013.
