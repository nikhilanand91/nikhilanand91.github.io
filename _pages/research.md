I'm broadly interested in understanding how large foundation models work, as well as making them more capable and efficient.  Some topics I've worked on before include data quality, and training models for API usage.  Previously, I've worked on the science of deep learning and in theoretical physics, and still maintain interest in those topics.  You can find my publications on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=L-QbDz8AAAAJ&hl=en).
