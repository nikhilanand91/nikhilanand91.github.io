I'm currently a senior research scientist at Harvard's [Kempner Institute](https://kempnerinstitute.harvard.edu/), where I work on understanding foundation models.  Before that, I was a research scientist at Amazon and before that, I was a theoretical physicist in the [Simon's Collaboration on the Nonperturbative Bootstrap](https://bootstrapcollaboration.com/).  I completed by PhD in 2018 at Johns Hopkins University where I was advised by [Jared Kaplan](https://sites.krieger.jhu.edu/jared-kaplan/).
