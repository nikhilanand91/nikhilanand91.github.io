Hi, I'm Nikhil!

I'm a senior research scientist at Harvard's [Kempner Institute](https://kempnerinstitute.harvard.edu/).  Before that, I was a research scientist at Amazon working on NLP and before that, I was a postdoctoral fellow in theoretical physics at McGill University as part of the [Simon's Collaboration on the Nonperturbative Bootstrap](https://bootstrapcollaboration.com/).  I completed by PhD in 2018 at Johns Hopkins University where I was advised by [Jared Kaplan](https://sites.krieger.jhu.edu/jared-kaplan/), and my Bachelor's at UC Berkeley.

Research
======

I'm broadly interested in better understanding how large foundation models work, as well as making them more capable and efficient.  Some topics I've worked on before include data quality, and training models for API usage.  Previously, I've worked on the science of deep learning and in theoretical physics, and still maintain interest in those topics.  You can find my publications on [Google Scholar]()
